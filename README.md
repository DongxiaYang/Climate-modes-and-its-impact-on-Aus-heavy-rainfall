Aim:Using climate modes (ENSO/IOD/MJO) to simulate/predict the tropical Australian Rainfall variation based on RF/XGboost Machine Learning models
Input features:
Weekly/Monthly ENSO/IOD leading rainfall anomaly by 1-6 months, MJO leading rainfall anomaly by 1-6 weeks.
Input Data Source:

Loss function: RMSE

How to tune hyperparameters?

1)skilearn gridsearch function  
2) self-define function
